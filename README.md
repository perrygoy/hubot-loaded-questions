======================

Play Loaded Questions, the game where guessing the answers gets you in just as much trouble as giving your own.

## The Game
Loosely based on the hit board game by Freshly Completed, http://freshlycompleted.blogspot.com/2013/11/loaded-questions-free-printable-game.html

A typical game of Loaded Questions follows these steps:
* Someone types `!loadquestion` in the Loaded Questions room.
```asciidoc
[hubot APP] *NEW ROUND STARTED!!!*

The current question is: *"If you could add one feature to your cell phone, what would it be?"*
You can submit your own answer by sending me a private message beginning with `submit answer`, followed by your answer
```
* Anyone who wants to play sends a PM to Hubot in the format `submit answer HERE IS WHERE MY ANSWER GOES!`
* Once enough people have submitted answers (the default number is 5 people, see [Configuration](#configuration) below), a countdown begins (the default is 5 minutesâ€”again, see [Configuration](#configuration)!) to end the round. Or, someone can say `!endquestion` to end the round early.
* After the round is ended, Hubot will say:
```asciidoc
[hubot APP] *ROUND ENDED!!!* (due to timeout)

There were 6 answers submitted for _"If you could add one feature to your cell phone, what would it be?"_:
> *1.* a pez dispenser
> *2.* send schedule text messages to my parents
> *3.* A "receive call" feature would be sweet. :(
> *4.* lead into gold
> *5.* a spray bottle
> *6.* curing diseases for a nominal fee (paid directly to me)


Players whose answers haven't been guessed: *user2*, *user1*, *user6*, *user4*, *user5*, *user3*.
To guess who submitted an answer, say `!guessanswer [number] [username]`.
```
* Users can then optionally guess who submitted each answer by saying `!guessanswer` or `!ga` followed by their guess.
* As each answer is guessed, Hubot will let you know if you guessed correctly or incorrectly. You can re-print the answers list to see which answers have been guessed so far (or because the list has scrolled way off the screen) by saying `!printanswers`.
* Once all the answers are guessed, Hubot will wait patiently for the next round!

After playing for a while, you can see stats for the game by saying `!lqstats`, or stats for individual players by saying `!lqstats [username]`.

## Configuration
Loaded Questions has these configurable values:
* `HUBOT_LOADED_QUESTIONS_ROOM` - which channel name or ID to post messages to (this game can be a little spammy, so it's best to have a dedicated room). Default is #random.
* `HUBOT_LOADED_QUESTIONS_QUORUM` - how many answers to wait for before triggering a countdown to end the round. Default is 5.
* `HUBOT_LOADED_QUESTIONS_SKIPNUM` - how many users must agree to skip a question before it is skipped. Default is 2.
* `HUBOT_LOADED_QUESTIONS_TIMEOUT` - how many minutes to wait during the countdown before the round ends. Default is 5.

Loaded Questions also comes with a default set of 275 questions, and more can be added if your friends have some good ones by creating a `loaded_questions.json` file in the `res/` directory at the root of your Hubot project. Here's an example of what that might look like:
```json
// hubot/res/loaded_questions.json
[
    "Ding dong! Who's there?",
    "Doctors hate him! What did he do?",
    "Excuse me, how do I get to the nearest gas station?"
]
```

Loaded Questions will find those extra questions and add 'em to the mix.

## Commands
* `!loadquestion` - (public only) starts a new question, if there isn't one currently.
* `!printquestion` - (public or pm) prints the current question.
* `!skipquestion` - (public only) votes to skips the current question and load a new one.
* `!endquestion` - (public only) ends the round of questioning and displays the answers.
* `!printanswers` - (public or pm) prints the answers that were given during the round.
* `!guessanswer [number] [user]` - (public only) guess that answer `number` was submitted by `user`. You can shortcut this command with `!ga [number] [user]`.
* `submit answer [answer]` - (pm only) submits your answer to the question.
* `!lqstats [username]` - (public or pm) shows some stats about the game. Optionally include a username to see stats for that specific user.

Uses hubot brain to keep track of the game state and some stats.

## Issues
If you find a bug, please let me know about it at https://github.com/perrygoy/hubot-loaded-questions/issues. This module was exclusively tested on Slack, so I'm not sure how it behaves on other chat clients.
